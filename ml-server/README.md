## Setup

### Local Development

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

### Docker Development

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f ml-server
```

## Run

### Standalone

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### With Docker

```bash
docker-compose up ml-server
```

## Model Training

### Train Event Classifier

```bash
# Option 1: Run training script directly
python train_models.py

# Option 2: Use API endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/train/event-classifier

# Train Schedule Optimizer
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/train/schedule-optimizer

# Train Pattern Detector  
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/train/pattern-detector

# Train All Models
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/train/all

# Check model status
curl http://localhost:8000/models/status
```

The training script generates 5000 synthetic samples based on realistic event patterns and trains a Random Forest classifier.
